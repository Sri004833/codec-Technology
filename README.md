Spam Email Classifier

🔧 Use TF-IDF instead of CountVectorizer (better for real-world data).

🤖 Try a different model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Logistic Regression.

💾 Save + Load model with joblib for fast reuse.

🖥️ Build a simple GUI (with Tkinter) or Web App (with Flask).
Train a model to detect and filter spam emails based on email content.
Use techniques like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.
💾 Files Saved
spam_classifier_model.pkl – the trained SVM model

vectorizer.pkl – the TF-IDF vectorizer

🖥️ Next Step Options (your pick):
Build a desktop GUI with Tkinter.

Create a Flask web app where users paste in an email to classify.

Turn it into a REST API endpoint for integration.
